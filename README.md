# Understanding Human Trafficking
Understanding Human Trafficking is a project developed by faculty, students, and staff at Washington and Lee University. This repository contains project management information.

The stories of trafficking survivors provide deep personal expressions that, along with scholarly research, foster an engaged understanding of the causes and issues in human trafficking.
