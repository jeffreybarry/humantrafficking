##H2 Adding items to the UHT Database

This document describes the procedure for adding an item to the Understanding Human Trafficking database.

##H3 Database formats

Database entries should be one of seven formats:

- Image
- Video
- Audio
- Synthesis
- Statistic
- Link
- Map (functionality not currently supported)

Because the UHT database is intended to collect brief, to-the-point and text-light information related to human trafficking, there is not a database format for narrative or extended original text. Such content would likely be more appropriate for the Blog section.

##H3 Adding an item to the database

1. On the WP sidebar, hover over "Database Entries" and select "Add new."
2. From the "Format" box on the database entry sidebar, select the database type you are entering from the checkboxes. Only check one box.
3. In the "Post Attributes" box directly below the "Format" box, select the template that corresponds to your database type from the "Template" drop-down menu. For example, if you checked "Video" in the "Format" box, you should choose "DB Entry Video" from the "Template" drop-down menu.
4. Fill out the database fields. Some fields will be required, while others are optional. Include as much information as you have available.
5. Add a Subject and Summary Description. These are for internal use, and will not appear on the public site, but are helpful for organizing and reviewing database content. The subject should be a brief phrase that indicates the most important subject of the item, while the summary description should be a more detailed description of what the item is and what it is about.
6. Tag the database entry. In the "Tags" box on the sidebar, add 1-3 tags that most relate to the content. These tags should be drawn from the pre-defined list of site tags. Because the tags are a major element of site navigation, you should not add new tags if at all possible. If you think a new tag is needed, consult with the project lead and the website administrator.
7. Publish the entry. Because the database templates are custom templates, the "Preview" function will not accurately display the entry.
8. Review the published entry. Click on the link for the database entry and ensure that it is displaying all the information in the correct format. If the entry looks incorrect, return to the entry page and ensure that you've selected the right format and template.
